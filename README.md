# Regression-Pumpkin

## Project Notebook: `notebook.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook is part of the Regression-Pumpkin project and serves as a detailed, interactive environment for executing and exploring the code. It demonstrates the underlying model or system's functionality, usage, and potential applications.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction**: Provides background information and the objectives of the notebook.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps for loading and preparing data, if applicable.
3. **Model Implementation**: Code and explanations for implementing the model or logic.
4. **Results and Analysis**: Evaluation of the model's performance, visualizations, and insights.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and suggestions for future work or experiments.

## Getting Started
